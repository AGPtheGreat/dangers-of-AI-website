        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
            System Daemons is a team of students, researchers, innovators, and visionaries dedicated to shaping a future where artificial intelligence serves humanity responsibly. 
            Founded in 2025, our mission is to ensure that AI technologies are developed, deployed, and maintained with transparency, accountability, and a strong ethical foundation.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            At System Daemons, we believe that AI should empower individuals, respect rights, and enhance societal well-being — not exploit vulnerabilities or reinforce inequality.
            Our commitment is to foster ethical awareness among developers, businesses, and users alike, offering practical guidelines and insight into the responsible use of AI.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Stand For</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> AI systems must be understandable, explainable, and open to scrutiny.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Organizations must take responsibility for the behavior and consequences of their AI tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> AI should be designed and tested to prevent bias and discrimination.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Individuals' data must be safeguarded, with informed consent at the core of any AI-driven system.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Critical decisions must remain under human review, especially in sensitive areas like healthcare, law, and finance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why AI Ethics Matters</h2>
        <p>
            As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life — from hiring algorithms to predictive policing — ethical lapses can have profound real-world consequences.
            Biases in training data, lack of transparency, and unchecked surveillance can erode trust, deepen social divides, and even cause harm to vulnerable populations.
        </p>
        <p>
            By focusing on AI ethics, we aim to build a world where innovation and integrity coexist — where technology amplifies the best of humanity, rather than magnifying its worst.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Work</h2>
        <p>
            System Daemons produces research reports, offers workshops and consulting, and collaborates with organizations to build ethical AI frameworks. 
            We are also committed to public education, running campaigns and resources — like this website — to make complex ethical issues accessible to everyone.
        </p>

        <h2>Get Involved</h2>
        <p>
            We invite you to explore our resources, participate in our survey, and help us champion an ethical future for AI. 
            Your voice matters — whether you're a developer, policymaker, educator, or everyday user. Together, we can make a difference.
        </p>
